# elisttm.space (flask)

in short, this is a hub site for me to store and show off my public projects

this version runs on flask, and is presently used on [my website](https://elisttm.space/) (old version [here](https://github.com/elisttm/elisttmspace))

if you have any questions, comments, or whatever, contact me
